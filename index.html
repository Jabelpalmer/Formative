    <h1>Welcome to Computer Programing</h1>

    <p>In this course, you will learn how to write programs to solve a variety of problems.  Programming can be very rewarding (when it works!) and very frustrating (when it doesn’t!), so a fair amount of persistence and patience are required.</p>
    
    <p>You are receiving a math credit for this class, therefore many of the problems you solve and programs you write will be math-based.  At times, you may need to “brush up” on some of the prerequisite math content.</p>
    
    </div>
    
    <p>Grading in this course is standards-based.  Please see the <a href=http://www.cvuhs.org/>CVU homepage</a> that describes how this works.</p>
    
    <p>Academic honesty is basically a nice way of saying <span class=Bold>“don’t cheat.”</span> This can be tricky within the world of computer programming, because it is quite typical to use pre-existing code that others have written within your own program.  Please follow these guidelines:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>If we ask for original work, we will expect that’s what we’ll get.</li>
      <li>If you do use others’ code (as agreed upon), please note the source in the comments.</li>
      <li>We do not tolerate cheating.  Do us both a favor, and don’t create a situation where you are removed from the class due to dishonesty.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>When you are in class, there are three expectations:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>You will make the most of the work time provided.</li>
      <li>You will be using the computers for programming </li>
      <li>You will be able to transition quickly and smoothly from independent and group work on the computers to whole class discussions. </li>
      
      
      
    </ol>
